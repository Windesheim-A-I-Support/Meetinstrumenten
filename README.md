## Objective
Systematically analyze and compare existing questionnaires used to measure Innovative Work Behavior (IWB) among nurses, with the goal of identifying valid and reliable instruments and building a foundation for a new context-specific questionnaire for community nursing.

## Dataset
- 85 peer-reviewed articles (1990–June 2025)
- Focus: studies measuring IWB in nursing using structured instruments

## Research Questions
1. Which questionnaires have been used to measure IWB among nurses?
2. What psychometric properties are reported for each questionnaire?
3. Are these properties sufficiently strong according to COSMIN criteria?
4. What definitions and dimensional structures of IWB are used across studies?
5. Which influencing factors are statistically associated with IWB?

## Methodology

### Data Structure
Analyzed variables include:
- Study objectives  
- Definitions of IWB  
- Dimensions and scales used  
- Psychometric properties (e.g. RMSEA, SRMR, Cronbach’s alpha)  
- Statistically significant relationships (positive/negative)  
- Theoretical frameworks used

### Evaluation Framework
Using COSMIN 2.0 criteria to assess:
- Content validity  
- Structural validity  
- Internal consistency  
- Cross-cultural validity / measurement invariance  
- Reliability  
- Measurement error  
- Hypotheses testing for construct validity  
- Responsiveness  
(Note: Criterion validity excluded)

### Tooling
- Excel: cleaned and structured database of extracted study data
- Python (Jupyter Notebook): visualization and comparison scripts
- AI (Perplexity): clustering of textual content (study goals, definitions)
- Local-only processing: no cloud or third-party storage

## Planned Outputs
- Overview tables of IWB measurement instruments
- Visualizations (e.g., timeline, world map by study location)
- Psychometric comparison of instruments across contexts
- Thematic summary of IWB definitions and theoretical bases
- Final recommendation of suitable IWB scales for use in district nursing

## Final Goal
Publish a peer-reviewed article that:
- Summarizes existing IWB instruments in nursing contexts
- Assesses their psychometric quality
- Recommends the most robust tools or highlights gaps for development

## Data Governance
- All data remains under the researcher's ownership
- No cloud storage or external uploads
- Full transparency and reproducibility guaranteed
